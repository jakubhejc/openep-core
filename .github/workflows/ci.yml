# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with MATLAB Actions

name: MATLAB Build

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [ master, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master, develop ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
